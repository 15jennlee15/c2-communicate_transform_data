# Course 2: Communicating and Transforming Data
This repository will house all the materials for the second course in the data science specialization using R, developed for the UO COE.

*Daniel Thought*
Should we change the title of this course? I was originally thinking we would have one or two weeks on best practices in data visualization, and then maybe talk more about different R Markdown formats. But looking at what we have on the google doc, I'm not seeing much of that (which is how I cam up with the learning objectives below). Alternatively, we could push some of this off to the third course and get the data vis and more advanced R Markdown stuff in here.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand keys and joins
	+ Be able to predict the output of different kinds of joins, and understand which is best suited to various scenarios.
* Understand the basics of string manipulations
	+ Be able to join, splitt, and subset strings, search for patterns, etc.
	+ Apply basic regular expressions (anchors, escapes, digits, etc.)
* Understand the underlying structure of factors, and when they are preferable to strings
* Be able to work with date data
	+ Create date data from strings
	+ Compute differences between dates
	+ Create time-series data
* Understand how to create and work with relational data
